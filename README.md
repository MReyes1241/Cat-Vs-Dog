This was my first project, it was made in python language. I was inspired by and helped through a tutorial on youtube. 
This is a simple project using the the pygames python library. the main point of the game is to resembele and old school arcade scpace shooter game.
It has functionality for 2 players and a point/life system that allows the player and the system when one player ahs one nd it is time to reset the game.
The game also features funtionality such as music.
